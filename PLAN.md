## Critical Issue: User Experience Mismatch

### Problem
User reports seeing "old version" despite extensive implementations in codebase.

### Root Cause
1. **Browser Cache**: Holding old "Scam Dunk" version
2. **Service Worker**: Caching outdated assets
3. **Local Storage**: May contain old data
4. **CDN Cache**: If deployed, may serve stale content

### Resolution Steps for Next Session
1. Clear all browser caches (Ctrl+Shift+Delete)
2. Unregister old service worker
3. Clear local storage and session storage
4. Update service worker version in code
5. Force rebuild with cache busting
6. Use incognito/private mode for testing

## Branding Update Summary
- ✅ All "Scam Dunk" references changed to "ScamShield"
- ✅ Logo updated from `scam-dunk-shield.png` to `scamshield-logo.png`
- ✅ Component `ScamDunkBadge` renamed to `ScamShieldBadge`
- ✅ 14 files updated with new branding

## Next Session Action Plan

### Priority 1: Fix User Experience (1 hour)
1. Update service worker version to force cache refresh
2. Implement cache busting strategy
3. Clear all caches and rebuild

4. Set up E2E tests with Playwright
5. Achieve minimum 70% coverage

### Priority 3: Complete Documentation (2 hours)
1. Generate API documentation with Swagger/OpenAPI
2. Create user onboarding guide
3. Write developer setup guide
4. Document all services and components

### Priority 4: Production Deployment (2 hours)
1. Build optimized production bundle
2. Set up CI/CD pipeline
3. Deploy to Vercel/Netlify
4. Configure proper caching headers
